# log4aerospike

Log4Aerospike is a log4j appender which allows log messages to be stored in an Aerospike NoSQL database

##Problem
Your Enterprise Java application uses the defacto industry standard logging facility Log4j. Log messages are generated through out your application and your application usage has become internet scale. As a result, your logging requirement has outstripped your capacity.

Additionally, you need now to query the logs in real-time to provide business intelligence and system diagnostics. 

##Solution
A solution is to use Aerospike NoSQL database as the log storage.

The source code for this solution is available on GitHub, and the README.md
